Heya folks ðŸ‘‹ ! I'm @jampamatos, one of many many MANY people who decided to try and change careeers and pick up a few new nice things along the way during the Pandemic.

I've been a programing geek for ever since I was a kid, but for reasons unknown never thought about really commiting to learn and understand it.

Now it seems a good time to change that.

I'm building my base skills through The Odin Project, but I have done a little bit of learning before with Zenva Academy Courses, Code Academy and Free Code Camp.

Hope to be good at it in NO TIME! ðŸ˜Ž
